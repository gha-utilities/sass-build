## Notes
[notes]:
  #notes
  "&#x1F5D2; Additional notes and links that may be worth clicking in the future"


To compile multiple files, define `source` and `destination` similarly to how you would assign `run` multiple commands. Make sure each file in `source` and `destination` are lined up.


```YAML
    - name: Compile main.css from main.scss
      uses: gha-utilities/sass-build@v0.6.1
      with:
        source: |
          _scss/main.scss
          _scss/global.scss
          _scss/articles/post.scss
        destination: |
          /tmp/repo-name/assets/css/main.css
          /tmp/repo-name/assets/css/global.css
          /tmp/repo-name/assets/css/articles/post.css
```

To pass compiled CSS to another workflow utilize the Upload and Download Actions from GitHub...


**`.github/workflows/build_css.yml`**


```YAML
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - src-pages


jobs:
  build_css:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout source Git branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
            ref: src-pages
            fetch-depth: 10
            submodules: true

      - name: Make destination directory for compiled CSS
        run: mkdir -vp /tmp/assets/css

      - name: Compile CSS from SCSS files
        uses: gha-utilities/sass-build@v0.6.1
        with:
          source: _scss/main.scss
          destination: /tmp/assets/css/main.css

      - name: Upload Complied CSS
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1.0.0
        with:
          name: Compiled-CSS
          path: /tmp/assets/css
```


**`.github/workflows/open_pull_request.yml`**


```YAML

          head: pr-pages
          base: gh-pages

This repository is influenced by tests preformed by `sass-utilities/gha-sass` which uses Docker powered GitHub Actions to achieve similar results. What differs are that this repository will start faster and enables configuring the build process further, see the [`action.yml`](action.yml) for currently available configurations.
